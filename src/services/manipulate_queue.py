    """Calculates how many positions forward a priority customer can be moved.

    This function determines the number of positions a given priority customer
    (`customer`, who is at `queue_n_times[0]`) can move ahead in the queue.
    It iterates through customers preceding the priority customer.

    A skip over a non-priority (NP) customer (`np_customer_to_skip`) is considered if:
    1. `np_customer_to_skip` has been jumped fewer times than `jumps_limit`.
    2. One of the following conditions for `np_customer_to_skip`'s waiting time is met:
        a. Its new estimated waiting time (if skipped by `customer`) does not
           exceed `non_p_threshold`.
        b. Its new estimated waiting time *does* exceed `non_p_threshold`,
           but `customer` has unused "special jumps" available from their
           `max_jumps_p` budget for this evaluation.

    The process of accumulating skips stops if:
    - A preceding customer is also a priority type.
    - An NP customer cannot be skipped due to their `jumps` count reaching `jumps_limit`.
    - An NP customer cannot be skipped because their `non_p_threshold` would be
      exceeded, AND the priority `customer` has no `max_jumps_p` budget remaining.
    - The priority `customer`'s own estimated waiting time falls below `p_threshold`.

    Args:
        queue_n_times: A list of (Customer, float) tuples. This list
            represents the segment of the queue from the priority customer
            (at index 0) up to the front, in reversed order. The float value
            is the customer's current estimated waiting time.
            `queue_n_times[0]` is the priority customer being evaluated.
        customer: The priority `Customer` object whose potential move is being
            evaluated. This should be identical to `queue_n_times[0][0]`.
        p_threshold: The target estimated waiting time for the `customer`.
        non_p_threshold: The maximum permissible estimated waiting time for
            any NP customer that `customer` skips (unless overridden by `max_jumps_p`).
        priority_tickets: A set of ticket type strings that identify
            priority customers.
        service_times_repo: A `Repository` instance used to retrieve
            estimated service times.
        max_jumps_p: The maximum number of times the evaluating `customer` can
            force a jump over an NP customer even if `non_p_threshold` is
            exceeded for that NP customer, during this specific evaluation call.
        jumps_limit: The absolute maximum number of times any NP customer
            can be jumped over in their lifetime in the queue.

    Returns:
        An integer representing the number of positions the `customer` can be
        moved forward (i.e., number of NP customers successfully skipped).

    This function evaluates priority (P) customers whose total estimated waiting
    time exceeds `p_threshold`. It attempts to move them forward by skipping
    non-priority (NP) customers.

    A P customer can skip an NP customer if:
    - The NP customer has been jumped fewer than `jumps_limit` times.
    - Skipping them doesn't make the NP customer's wait time exceed `non_p_threshold`,
      OR the P customer uses one of their `max_jumps_p` allowances for the current
      evaluation round (as determined by `calculate_customer_new_position`).

    If a P customer is moved, the `jumps` attribute of the NP customers they
    skipped over is incremented.

    The process is iterative (stabilization loop): after any move, estimated
    waiting times are recalculated, and the queue is re-evaluated from the
    beginning until no more moves are made in a full pass.

        queue: The live priority queue object.

        non_p_threshold: Maximum permissible total waiting time for an NP
            customer skipped by a P customer (can be overridden by `max_jumps_p`).
        current_time: Current time for calculating total estimated wait times.
        max_jumps_p: The budget a P customer has in a single evaluation call
            to `calculate_customer_new_position` to make "threshold-breaking"
            jumps.
