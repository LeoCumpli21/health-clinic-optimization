"""Simulates patient arrivals for a health clinic using Non-Homogeneous Poisson Processes.

This module provides functions to simulate arrival times based on historical
arrival rate data. It includes utilities for:
- Calculating the maximum arrival rate (lambda_max) for a given location and group.
- Retrieving the specific arrival rate (lambda(t)) for a given time.
- Simulating arrival times using the thinning algorithm for NHPP.
- Analyzing and plotting the simulated arrivals against actual rates.
- Orchestrating the entire simulation process.
